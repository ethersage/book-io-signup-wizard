# Sign-up Wizard & Dashboard API

#### This is intended to be used with the Book.io Web Interview Project _Sign-up Wizard & Dashboard_

## Installation & Running
```
$ git clone <this repo>
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

This will start a web server (the signup app) listening on port `8080` and the API server will be listening on port `9000`

## Monorepo

The original sample API has been restructured into a monorepo, with the API under `packages/api` and the signup web app under `packages/signup-wizard`.
